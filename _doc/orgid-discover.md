To find potential partners in the marketplace, one should browse the registered participants.

There are two ways to find other participants:

* Using a web browser, Winding Tree hosts a user-friendly interface:
  * In live environment: [https://marketplace.windingtree.com/search](https://marketplace.windingtree.com/search)
  * In test environment: [https://staging.arbor.fm/search](https://staging.arbor.fm/search)
* Interacting with the Smart Contract directly. This is the recommended approach for developers.

Using the smartcontract, it is possible to:

* List all organizations
* Get the details of one organization

Using the organization details stored in the smartcontract, it is possible to retrieve the associated JSON document that contains all the details of the organization.
