# Winding Tree Developers Portal

Welcome to the Winding Tree developer portal!

Winding Tree is an open ecosystem that aims at facilitating trade between travel suppliers and travel buyers. Winding Tree is leveraging the Ethereum blockchain to provide a trusted environment for all participants to transact, big or small.

On this portal, developers will find all required information to get started on Winding Tree, creating their organization then exposing or consuming travel content.

If you see anything missing or unclear, or if you wish to contribute please open an Issue or
Pull Request on this portal's [Github Repository](https://github.com/windingtree/developer-portal).

Here are the initial pointers:

* Heads-up to the [Architecture](/docs/architecture/) to get the big picture
* Create your organization using the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.windingtree.com) user interface or [programatically](/docs/orgid/register/).
