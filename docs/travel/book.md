# How to book content from the marketplace?

This section describes how to book travel content from the marketplace.

Travel content can be booked directly by travel businesses such as Online Travel agencies (OTA), Corporates but also across verticals (for example an airline booking hotels for its staff).

Travel content and inventory is not stored on the blockchain, instead travel buyers authenticate and connect to the public API endpoints of travel suppliers to retrieve offers and create bookings.

Prequisites:

* [Register your organization](/docs/orgid/register/) in Winding Tree marketplace, including a __public key__ to authenticate your server
* [Register your banking details](/docs/payment/account/) in Simard and make an initial deposit to cover your expenses
* [Discover](/docs/orgid/discover) travel suppliers you would like to book

Based on the profile of the travel suppliers you want to integrate with, you can either rely on this single partner for all your requests, or you can go one step further and dynamically contact providers depending on your needs and their coverage.

Once you know which travel suppliers you will reach out to, you can integrate their APIs as documented in the [Publish Section](/docs/travel/publish). It is the same API for everyone!
